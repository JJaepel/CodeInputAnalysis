function ce = dendriteSubstraction(ce, info)

% This function removes the dendritic component from the spine ROIs
%
% Inputs:
% - ce: structure containing in each row one ROI with anatomical
% information, raw trace, dff trace and stimulus chopped trace = cyc
% - info: structure containing all the information about this experiment
%
% Ouput:
% - ce: updated with cycRes, containing the spineOnly signal trace, and
% corr as a measurement of how much the spine is still related to the
% dendrite
% -ROIChopped.mat: ROI file containing the updated ce
